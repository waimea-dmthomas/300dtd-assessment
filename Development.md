**Planning the database in DrawSQL**

I began working on planning the potential database using DrawSQL. This will be used as a framework for what the actual database may function like and look like in MySQL clearly and concisely. I gave "forum topics" (sections i.e. general, off-topic) their own database instead of being a column under threads because this means admins could add new topics to the site through an admin menu, instead of having to hardcode it in the sites HTML/CSS.

**Excalidraw flowchart prototype**

I started working on a flowchart in Excalidraw which illustrates how the website will flow and function on a base level. The yellow circles represent where the user starts, blue squares are pages, purple diamonds are header buttons and red/green boxes are functional buttons.

> A user suggested that the database be updated to include the admin permissions under "users"

The DrawSQL "users" database now includes an admin column which is a boolean.

**Figma website design prototype**

I began to work on the prototype layout and flow of the website using the site Figma.

I decided to prioritize the mobile design first and then I would do the desktop design later. This design also doesn't have a color scheme so I stuck to greys since it would make it easier to apply color palettes later. I also used lorem ipsum text and placeholder images/icons to demonstrate where text/images would occur while not breaking the flow of the site. I wanted to use simple and clear fonts for easy readability and I tried to fill as much of the screen as possible to not create dead space and for an efficient design.

I intend to present this design to my end-user for refinements and improvements as well as potential ideas for a color scheme and desktop design.

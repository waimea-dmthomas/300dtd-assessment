Planning the database in DrawSQL

I began working on planning the potential database using DrawSQL. This will be used as a framework for what the actual database may function like and look like in MySQL clearly and concisely. I gave "forum topics" (sections i.e. general, off-topic) their own database instead of being a column under threads because this means admins could add new topics to the site through an admin menu, instead of having to hardcode it in the sites HTML/CSS.

Excalidraw flowchart prototype

I started working on a flowchart in Excalidraw which illustrates how the website will flow and function on a base level. The yellow circles represent where the user starts, blue squares are pages, purple diamonds are header buttons and red/green boxes are functional buttons.

The DrawSQL "users" database now includes an admin column which is a boolean.

Planning the database in MySQL

I began working on planning the potential database using MySQL. This will be used as a framework for what the actual database may function like and look like, depicting it visually. I gave topics their own database instead of being a column under threads because this means admins could add new topics to the site through an admin menu instead of having to hardcode it in the HTML/CSS.

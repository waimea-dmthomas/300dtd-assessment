Project Name: **PBS Forums**

Project Author: **Daniel Thomas**

Assessment Standards: **91902** and **91903**

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

Since the closure of the official ROBLOX forums and the fragmentation of the old ROBLOX community into various Discord servers, groups and isolated communities, there has been no centralized place to share progress, foster discussion or present discoveries regarding the past. Many, many different projects are buried in the depths of year-old Discord chats, never to see the light of day again. 

### End-User Requirements

The user base will be those who have come to the website presumably already involved or interested in old ROBLOX history and or preservation. Many of these people will be programmers who are familiar with LuaU and could come from any background, however most of these people will be ages 14-25ish.

### Proposed Solution

I propose a standalone forum which aims to facilitate discussion, teamwork and unity where projects can find their own threads and tangents have a place to flourish.
